# FilterOptimizer
A tool to make filters more accurate by adding different variants of a pre-existing word file.

Q: What Does It Do?
A: This program will take a txt file that you provide and make a copy of each word in the list into UPPERCASE, lowercase, and Title Case. to help optimize 
filters such as discord bots. 

This program is in VERY EARLY ACCESS so there will be many issues but is small and reliable as far as I have tested.

Biggest test: 10 Million words in 1 second.
